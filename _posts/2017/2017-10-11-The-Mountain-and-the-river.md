"Pa I can't sleep" came a timid voice from a curled up blanket. "Me too" replied Pa in his deep yet a soothing voice. The little two-legged creature sprang out of her bed, her
hair almost kissing the floor, and rushed to snuggle up in her pa's lap. It was a very special bonding shared between this 80-year-old man and his 5-year-old granddaughter.

"Let me tell you a beautiful story" - "a story" lit up her blue eyes! "Yes - a love story," said
Pa in his husky voice. "But I don't know what is love, Pa". "Neither Did I.." chuckled the old man.

He picked up his guitalele and started.

> I am gonna tell you a story..  
> story of `mountain and a river`..    
> listen closely my daughter..  
> story of him and her..  

> He was a boulder, taller than sky..  
> little did he move when the tide was high..  
> She was a river, narrow and shy..  
> gushing through the canyon as years passed by..  


"But Pa, how can river and Mountain come together ?" 

> A thousand years passed by..  
> the river dried out and that's when the mountain cried !  
> Now he misssed her..  
> Oh he wish, he had kissed her..  
> so he looked up into the sky..  
> and made a wish in his cry..  

"And then there were dark clouds and thundering !" Frightened, she covered her eyes.

Pa, continued..

It rained almost for a month. When the dark clouds cleared and the bright sun came,
there lay a beautiful blue lake in the crater up above the mountain.

> She filled his crater -  that river..  
> pouring herself from the skies..  
> living happily forever..  
> the mountain and river  

"Aren't you two sleeping now ??" - yelled the `lake` from another room !
