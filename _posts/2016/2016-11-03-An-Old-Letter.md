> Do it and regret. Don't do it and regret more !

"It's not working out, I think we should move on." He knew Tanya and her idiosyncrasies. "I know 
she would be fine tomorrow morning" he reminded himself like he always did.

Like a weed clinging to a cracked wall, Raj was clinging on to his dying relationship.
And if you think this was not the end then perhaps you should know how he abandoned his startup only to realize
that the other co-founders made millions just by pushing a little harder than him.

The problem was that he had risked it even more by playing it safe. He felt time slipping through his hands like a sand, but well isn't time always slipping like  that ?

Just as he was about to shred the offer to work with NatGeo - wild. He received an email dated : 23rd March 2003.

The old [scheduled mail](https://www.futureme.org/){:target="_blank"} was written by a 16-year-old Raj, quite different than who he was now.

>Sometimes we just need to hop into that car that passes by. Take a detour. Digress a little (or perhaps more ?). 
>It is the journey that will be Worth telling your grandkids for nobody cares about the destination.
>Don't be scared. Well if you are then that's a good thing. You're challenging yourself.

>You wouldn't know if it was the right decision or not ? As a matter of fact, there is no right answer to it.
>You , My friend, you are the one who has to make it right for what it's all worth for.
>As it is rightly said you cannot connect the dots going forward but only going backward.
>So step away , move ahead and fill your heart and mind with that hope of connecting the dots in a story that will inspire generations to come.
>
>If it all ends well, you'll have a hell of a story, if it doesn't then the story isn't over yet. 
>I hope you live a life that you are proud of , it's okay if the dots still don't connect 
>but you know what , I want, I want every single page of that book to be a thriller !

>So go and start scripting your story, before the ink gets dry !

>Good luck !

Tears rolled down the cheeks as he was intervened by his own past. In next five minutes, he dropped a resignation to his manager, something that he should have done 7 years ago. He called up Tanya to end the stagnant relationship, something that he should have done 4 years ago. And finally, he booked a single one-way ticket to Auckland, where his passion for wildlife beckons him ! - Something he could have only done by listening to his inner voice :)

It is funny to see what an ```old letter``` can do in five minutes, what a person could not in a decade's worth of time !
