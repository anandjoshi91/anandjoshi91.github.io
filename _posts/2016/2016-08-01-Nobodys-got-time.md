> “You’re so engrossed in your little world  
> A castle that you’ve built up with a pack of cards  
> Whiling away your time to chase things that won’t matter to you when you have it  
> but sadly you don’t realize that now ,  
> So go and get what you want , do what pleases you,  
> Just remember that someday you will have it all, be on top of the world but  
> none of that will matter because no one will have time for you !”

## Lyrics :

You can eat your money  
And you can drink your dime  
All your friends are busy  
Nobody’s got time  
  
where is all that glory ?  
And where is all that fame ?  
Oh it is such a shame  
Nobody’s got time  
  
I’ve done somethings  
Things I am not so proud of  
But I will face it  
I ain’t a coward  
  
I know it hurts  
But I can’t change the time  
I wasn’t there for you  
I need you to forgive me now  
  
And I will do it all  …  
To fix it all…that I can  
  
But I can’t eat my money  …  
I can’t drink the dime  
All my friends are busy  
I wish I could go back in time  …  

<br/>

— A man who once lost to time
