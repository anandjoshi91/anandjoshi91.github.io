“Nothing lasts forever” – and nothing really should ! I know it makes people afraid. Fear that has different words. Some call  it obsession some call it love but one should try to understand that at the end – it is just a bloody fear. I ain’t a big fan of religion. Some or most of them talk about ‘detachment’. What they really mean by it is that

In the end, it is not the number of years that you  have lived that counts, not the amount of wealth you have amassed that counts, what counts is how many lives you have touched ! For love is the  only eternal thing and perhaps the most divine creation of this universe.

So go out and love – love without fear, love without expectation,  love even if you know it won’t last forever because in the end it’s not the things you do that you regret but the things you don’t !
