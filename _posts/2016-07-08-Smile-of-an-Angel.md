## Lyrics :

When nothings going right  
and life looks so hazy…  

Don’t you be so dizzy,  
just shut your eyes…  

And you’ll find me there,  
you’ll feel me there,  
you’ll see me there,  
you’ll hear me there,  
I am sitting there, right next to you  
Can’t you see that ?  

I miss you so much, no words can say.  

I’ll walk a thousand mile to see that precious smile,  
the smile of an angel…  

Have so much to say but you’re so far away…  
What keeps me alive is your smile !  

<br/>
