> It ain’t about how hard you hit it’s about how hard you can get hit and still keep moving. That’s how winning is done !

<br/>


<center>You will be hurt  </center>
<center>Your dreams might be shattered  </center>
<center>You will have sleepless nights  </center>
<center>Maybe tear and fright  </center>
<center>But then these are the moments that will test you  </center>
<center>Perhaps even break you  </center>
<center>You can choose to get crumbled  </center>
<center>Or you can get up and fight  </center>
<center>Fight till you stand victorious in that ring  </center>
<center>It is okay if you’re bleeding  </center>
<center>It’s okay if you’re bruised  </center>
<center>for the world will not care about it  </center>
<center>but will see a hero in the spotlight  </center>
<center>So the choice is yours  </center>
<center>may the referee pick up your hand in the end !  </center>
