In the pursuit of perfection, we often struggle to acknowledge our mistakes and imperfections. 
The Japanese art of Kintsugi beautifully exemplifies the profound beauty that emerges from embracing flaws. Kintsugi involves repairing broken pottery by filling the cracks with lacquer mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. Rather than concealing the fractures, this art form highlights them, turning the mended object into a stunning mosaic of resilience.

Just as the mended pottery becomes more valuable, our growth through acknowledgment of shortcomings enriches our lives in ways we might not have imagined.

In the end I would like to quote few lines from an old poem of mine which says that _it's not the failure of achieving something extraordinary, but unacceptance of our mistakes and perhaps a chance to grow from it, that breaks my heart !_

> રંગ માં રંગ કોઈ મેળવી ના શક્યું ..  
> શ્વાસમાં સુગંધ કોઈ ભેળવી ના શક્યું ..  
> એ ભૂલ હતી, જોકે બધાની ઘણી ..  
> એ ભૂલ હતી, જોકે  બધાની ઘણી ..  
> એ સૌ હતા કાયર, કે કોઈ સ્વીકારી ના શક્યું ..
