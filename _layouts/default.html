############################## Hello Hacker ########################################################

Hi Hacker ! Looks like you're more curious about my code than my articles :P
That's perfectly fine. I too, like inspecting websites. This blog is set up
using jekyll, again I have an article for that if you would like to know more.
Now avoid yourself the trouble of using these browser developer tools to analyse my website.
I have made things simpler, you can find the entire source code 
of my website here : https://github.com/anandjoshi91/anandjoshi91.github.io

Feel free to get in touch with me. I would love to hear your crazy ideas :)

Happy Coding \m/
